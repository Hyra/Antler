# What is Antlter
Antler is a starterkit or boilerplate app to kickstart your next Front-end project using all the bleeding edge libraries in an easy to understand architecture.

# The goal
The aim of this boilerplate is to stay small yet complete. It contains all the hot new toys you want to use, including examples on how to use them, but will try and stay small so it's not causing confusion through a lot of bloat-code.
