# Redux Starter
Most Redux boilerplates contain bloat or 'magic'. The goal of this repo is to be transparent and minimalistic whilst giving a starting point for a Redux App

## What should it contain

- react 0.14
- redux
- react-router
- redux DevTools
- webpack buildtool
- sass support
- folder structure that makes sense
- universal rendering ((very) nice to have)
- redux logger
- ability to communicate to external api based on config
- config for dev/staging/prod
